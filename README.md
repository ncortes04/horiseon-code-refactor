# horiseon-code-refactor
This assignment i was given a starter code that appeared functional on the webpage; however i discovered multiple things wrong with the html as well as the CSS. I have made changes to the code to make it more accesible to seaech engines without making major changes to the functionality or appearance of the webpage.
